Jul 20 2009, Felix Schmitt, Version 2.22
  - Updated i_help.ihf to reflect the latest changes
  - New feature: ability to selectively browse and delete data sets and 
    tight binding models in the cut planner window
  - minor bug fixes
  - bug fix: i_prettypretty used to not apply changes if the graph was
    selected from the list box instead of a focus change
  - bug fix/feature: i_prettypretty now imports contours as well. The
    contours now work properly.
  - New feature: import the cut geometry from the top graph currently 
    displayed in the display panel into the cut planner. Also, a live 
    display of the cut position from the display panel is possible now.


Jun 1 2009, Felix Schmitt, Version 2.20
  - Major bug fixes and code clean up. Bumped all version #pragma 
    statements, since the changes are relatively big.
  - New file: i_help.ihf, provides a global, centralized help/documentation
    for the entire i_photo. This should help new users get started and also
    make veterans familiar with changes and little quirks...
  - New module: i_lda, provides function to manipulate bxsf LDA files.
    i_fileloader now can load BXSF files, as for example produced by
    Wien2k.
  - New feature: real time contours in prettypretty.
  - MAJOR rewrite of the "Precise" FS mapping algorithm. It now features a
    homegrown Newtonian numerical backmapping that increases precision and
    runs by a factor 10 to 20 faster than the original algorithm. For the
    end user, that means that the FS map is more precise and runs more
    stable
    especially for the low energy (hn=7eV) FS maps.
  - Added new angle (alpha) throughout i_photo, in order to make them
    usable for the ALS system as well.
  - Added/ported Makoto's FITS loader for Eli Rothenberg's data
    acquisition software used at ALS.
  - Added feature: reference square, to help orienting the BZ in real
    time at the beam line.
  - Added a new field for the WaveNote/Metainfo called
    AngleSignConventions.
    This provides the capabilities to reverse the sign of any angle used
    in the FS mapping/conversion between angles and k-space. This was
    neccessary since not all our experimental setups have the same sign
    conventions for the rotation angles.
  - Added feature: DC has now the capability to overlay LDA bands over the
    data in real time.
  - Bug fixes include:
      - Prettypretty: added/fixed contours. Fixed crash whan starting up
        without any graphs at all. Wrote bug fix for Igor bug (Igor
        crashed when setting the contour numbers to zero, i.e. disabling
        contours). Changing the scale between relatve and absolute now
        works consistently. Changed graph scaling of range/contour slider
        graphs.
      - DC: cursors for EDC/MDC were reversed. Fixed.
      - Autosave fixes; autosave used to crash/stop working whenever
        somebody was editing a procedure file and Igor failed to compile
        them when it needed to call the autosave function. Now, as
        soon as the user compiles his/her code successfully, the autosave
        will restart automatically.
      - LDA tab in DC now has the right unit conversions attached to the
        check box...
      - Process: Macro names were reversed for reduce x/reduce y. Fixed.
      - Filetable: When multiple rows in a column were marked, the range
        popup appeared. When cancel was pressed, the first value of the
        selection was set to zero anyway. Fixed.
      - Fileloader: When loading multiple waves/Manipulator scans, the
        Igor sorting was not working correctly, since e.g. the wave w_2
        will come after w_19 and before w_20. Changed loader such that it
        would generate wave names with leading zeroes, i.e. w_001, ...
      - lda: module source code is now documented.
      - process: in the symmetrize tab, the EF value is now autofilled from
        the selected wave.
      - main module (i_photo): fixed auto-compile issue.


May 13 2008, Felix Schmitt, Version 2.10
  - Took out Igor's "advanced" image processing tools again, since these
    tools are made with the typical Igor philosophy: As many features as
    possible, and all of them half-assed. They are indeed very feature-
    rich, but none of them works properly. Instead provided i_prettypretty,
    which does pretty much the same, with the minor difference that
    i_prettypretty actually works.
  - minor bugfixes in i_DC
  - minor overall bugfixes: some buttons were dead after the massive
    rewrite since the names changed/because of typeos.
  - improved the Precise method in i_fsmap: it now can handle unequally
    spaced data sets. Also, the original algorithm had intensity ripples or
    bubbles. These artefacts of the method are now gone and the map is now
    much smoother.


Nov 1 2007, Felix Schmitt, Version 2.00

  - deleted image_contrast1.0
    Reason: Igor offers far more advanced image processing tools. See Image
    processing help in Igor Pro.
  i_help:
    - created a help panel that lets one browse all defined functions
      easily.
  i_init:
    - renamed to i_photo
    - modified initialization routines. No Igor version check is done
      anymore. Advantage is that it makes the code much more legible and
      flexible w/ regard to changes. Nothing clutters up the Procedures
      window anymore. Version check is done by setting #pragma IgorVersion
      = 5 in all module files. Only drawback is that this does not work for
      Igor version 3.04. But this is so old that nobody probably uses it
      anymore.
    - took out the main panel menu. It is now accessible through the
      i_photo scrolldown menu.
    The only drawback
  - deleted unneccessary files in i_photo
  - merged "whats new.rtf" and "Wei-Sheng's modifications" into this
    changelog
  - changed global naming scheme: Any Functions that are public are
    prefixed with their filename, e.g. the function to open the fs mapper
    is in file i_fsmap and thus is called fsmap_open(). Private functions
    are now private, using the Static keyword.
  i_mapper:
  - renamed to i_fsmap
  - almost completely rewritten. Offers now three different mapping
    methods:
    Voronoi, Precise, Baumberger. Baumerger method contains the vintage
    code. Changed the wavenote behavior; i_fsmap does not change them
    anymore. If there is something missing/not good, it will abort with an
    error and will ask you to use the completely revised i_filetable.
  i_filetable:
  - complete rewrite, featuring a dynamic table to change selected fields
    of the wavenotes. Also features a tab with defaults for common systems
    like SSRL, ALS and so on.
  BZ_mapper:
    - renamed to i_bzplanner
    - complete rewrite. Now features:
    - a TB model tab for easy graphing of TB models
    - more freedom in adding data
    - misc stuff like a way to map the experimental setup of the Wolf group
      in Berlin
  i_process:
    - added a primitive macro recorder that records all processing done on
      one wave and then lets you apply it to a selection of waves
  i_prefs:
  i_Utilities:
  - renamed to i_utils
  i_fit_core, i_fit_interface, i_fitfunction:
  - merged into one file, i_fit, and deleted afterwards
  i_LEED:
  - renamed into i_leed




DATE UNKNOWN, Wei-Sheng Lee, Version 1.02

  i_DC:
  - Add "BZPos" function
  i_process:
  - change the sign in map_flipStage_cut to match the SSRL case.
  - Add lattice constant information




Nov 12 2004, Felix Baumberger, Version 1.02

  new features and changed behaviors:

  - added two items to the marquee-menu for quick and easy normalization of
  1D
    and 2D waves
  - the DC panel now extracts and displays the collapsed DC, if the
    checkbox is activated
  - new 'drag and drop' loader for (hopefully all) croissant files.
  - drag and drop loader for tif, jpg, and bmp files
  - SES-loader reads now manipulator angles for 1.2.2 files

  bug fixes & minor changes:

    normalization:
    - angle calibration does no longer report a 'duplicate error'
    - all normalization functions should now work without any wave-note
    entries
    - liberal data-folder names do no longer produce cryptic error messages
    - cropping now updates slice-number and CCD-range in the wave-note
    - angle calibration now allows negative deg/channel values

    display-panel:
    - better attempt to find meaningful axis labels
    - "add DC" no longer overwrites trace colors
    - collapse/uncollapse works now for both DCs in the display panel
    - DC-offsets work now correctly for less than 3 DCs and for DCs
    containing
      NaNs
    - the last DC is no longer offset in y

    fit-panel:
    - improved stability and convergence when fitting to convolutions
    - corrected formulas for Fermi-liquid, marginal-Fermi-liquid, and
      'empirical-Fermi-liquid' in the fit-panel
    - 'top-graph' button works

    gold-panel:
    - solved the convergence problem that appeared in Igor 5.02

    mapper:
    - returns no longer an empty map, if the energy window is smaller than
      the step-size in the data
    - works now correctly for multiple manipulator angles in the direction
      of the analyzer parallel-detection
    - 'edit' button for offsets works
    - removed annoying interpolation artifacts along the boundaries of the
      map
    - added option 'normalize to 1' in the angular transmission function
      normalization

  Windoze-specific:
  - igor-version check works now correctly on Windows
  - improved positioning of command window and main panel
